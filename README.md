- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pedro Velazquez, an Italo-Argentine passionate about back-end development and focused on creating elegant and efficient code.
-   I enjoy challenges that enable me to learn new subjects and apply creative solutions, even more if they are real-word scenarios I am passionate about.
Open to work within Europe, Argentine or full-remote.
